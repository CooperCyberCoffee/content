# AI Security Research & Experiments
*Weekly technical deep-dives exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity*

## About This Repository

This repository contains technical research and working code that supports my LinkedIn thought leadership series on AI-enhanced cybersecurity. Each week, I explore practical applications of AI in security operations through hands-on experiments and tool development.

**Important Note:** All research is conducted under the fictional "Cooper Cyber Coffee" company - a narrative framework I created to explore real security scenarios in a realistic business context. Think of it as a cybersecurity sandbox where I can test ideas, build tools, and demonstrate concepts without involving actual organizations.

## What is Cooper Cyber Coffee?

Cooper Cyber Coffee is a **fictional specialty coffee company** I use as a backdrop for security research. Named after FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (Twin Peaks) - famous for his methodical investigative approach and coffee obsession - it provides a consistent narrative framework for exploring enterprise security challenges.

Why use a fictional company?
- Test real security tools against realistic business scenarios
- Demonstrate enterprise security concepts without exposing actual company data
- Create relatable content that security professionals can map to their own environments
- Build a consistent narrative that makes technical concepts more accessible

## Research Focus Areas

My weekly experiments explore:
- **AI-Enhanced Threat Intelligence:** Using LLMs to accelerate threat analysis
- **Security Tool Automation:** Building MCP servers and automation frameworks
- **Adversarial AI:** Understanding how threat actors weaponize AI capabilities
- **Detection Engineering:** Creating AI-powered detection rules and methodologies
- **Risk Assessment:** Quantifying AI-related security risks for enterprises

## Recent Highlights

- **Week 1 (2025):** LAMEHUG Analysis - Analyzing AI-enhanced human trafficking operations and their implications for enterprise security
- **Week 3 (2025):** STIX Extraction Challenge - Testing LLMs' ability to extract valid STIX objects from PDF threat reports
- **Upcoming:** OpenCTI MCP Server - Building production-ready threat intelligence automation

## Technical Philosophy

Every experiment follows these principles:
1. **Practical Over Theoretical:** All code is tested and functional
2. **Enterprise-Focused:** Solutions that scale to real-world environments
3. **Tool-Agnostic:** Demonstrations work with open-source and commercial tools
4. **Reproducible:** Complete documentation so others can replicate results
